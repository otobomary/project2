            <h2>Bitcoin Mining</h2>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionB">
        <p>Bitcoin has a public ledger which is called the blockchain. The process of mining adds new transactions to
            this public ledger. Why? Well, Bitcoin users need this process because it means that
            every transaction is securely confirmed and verified while all the users making use of the Bitcoin network
            has full access to the blockchain – in other words, the Bitcoin ledger. Mining also helps the network figure
            out which transactions
            are fair and legit, eliminating any transactions that try to spend money a second time.</p>
        <p>So when someone “mines” Bitcoin they are in fact performing a service to all Bitcoin users because they
            ensure Bitcoin transactions are legitimate. During the
            process of mining people who mine Bitcoin will complete a new block which means that the miner gets a
            reward. In 2018 the return for completing a new block was 12.5 Bitcoin, but the reward gets lower with time.
        </p>
        <P>As you can imagine, mining requires a lot of hard work and patience – you do not get Bitcoin mining results
            quickly. So there’s an obvious analogy with actual, physical mining of metals like gold.
            Hence using the word “mining” for the computational tasks that generate new Bitcoin.</P>
        <P>Choosing your mining equipment
            Mining Bitcoin involves very complex calculations which are very computationally intensive. So, choosing the
            right hardware kit when you mine Bitcoin is really essential. You need to think about a number of specific
            characteristics when you choose your Bitcoin mining kit.
        </P>
        <p>
            Hash rates
            Perhaps the key aspect of your mining kit choice is this: the hash rate that your mining hardware can
            sustain. Hash rate is basically the number of crypto calculations that your mining hardware can perform
            every second. It’s easy to see why a higher hash rate will help you mine coins more quickly – simply because
            more calculations
            per second mean that you solve the crypto math required to mine a coin much more quickly. As a result you
            can quickly complete a block and get your reward for doing so.
        </p>
        <P>Hash functions work like this: whatever input you insert will always give you the same output. So to find a
            specific output you have to try as many random inputs as you can – as fast as you can. It makes mining
            competitive and the miner who can process more inputs than other miners will end up getting rewarded faster.
            So, again, if you can get hardware
            with a high hash rate you will have an advantage over other miners which means you get more rewards more
            quickly.</P>

        <p>The rate of measurements for hash rates is MH/sec, which is short for megahashes per second. You can also
            measure hash rates in terms of GH/sec and TH/sec, standing for giga- and terahashes per second respectively.
            Bitcoin mining hardware
            have hash rates which can range from a few hundred MH/sec all the way to 10 TH/sec (or 10,000,000 MH/sec).
        </p>
        <p>Cost of energy
            There are costs involved with mining Bitcoin, and it’s not just the physical mining hardware you need to
            worry about. If you can afford powerful hardware you will quickly find you have another headache: the
            electricity cost associated with driving that hardware because powerful mining hardware consume a lot of
            power.
        </p>
        <p>When buying hardware you therefore need a close look at the electricity consumption of the kit – work it out
            in watts and then see how much it will cost you, so that you don’t get a big surprise when you get your next
            electricity bill. If you don’t you risk spending all your mining profits on electricity – or indeed face
            making a big loss.</p>
        <p>Hash rate alongside energy consumption is a good way to evaluate mining profits. Compare the hashes you can
            complete in an hour with the cost of electricity per hour (or per day). An easy way to do this is to divide
            the hash rate of your kit by the watts consumed. It’ll give you a MH/s per watt rate which can
            guide you, alongside current electricity costs, to find whether your mining kit will produce a profit.</p>
        <p>Don’t forget to include extra costs like the computer hardware that drives mining GPUs when you calculate
            profits - your PC will also consume power on top of the mining hardware that you have.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin mining hardware options
            When Bitcoin was just released a wide variety of people paid attention as it was a unique idea that people
            found very liberal. In any case, Bitcoin was very revolutionary compared to the way transactions were
            processed before: by centralised banks.
            In these early days of Bitcoin less people knew about the cryptocurrency and fewer people were buying and
            investing in Bitcoin, so the value of Bitcoin was not as high. The result was that it was easy to mine
            Bitcoin which meant that there were many miners interested in mining Bitcoin for profit, but they were also
            interested in Bitcoin because it was such an incredible, novel idea. Back then, mining Bitcoin required the
            use of basic computing power – even a laptop was enough, or a powerful desktop computer.This self-governing
            network was outside the remit of financial institutions, tax authorities and other big organisations because
            it was completely decentralised.</p>
        <p>Through this process of mining Bitcoin with laptop and desktop computers people started realising that GPUs
            (graphics cards) were capable of really boosting Bitcoin mining ability. GPUs are well-suited for Bitcoin
            mining: GPUs consume less power than a computer CPU dedicated to mining and GPUs can mine at 50 to 100 times
            the rate.</p>
        <P>As a result dedicated devices which were custom-designed for mining was introduced to the market. Mining
            capabilities multiplied and this lead to an interesting development: Bitcoin mining farms which were
            effectively profit centres – and which led to the development of a more formal industry dedicated to mining
            Bitcoin.</P>
        <p>
            Over time Bitcoin mining has become very profitable and a lot of serious miners operate very large Bitcion
            mining farms that generate a lot of money. It’s a mix of hardware involved in these mining farms – including
            GPUs alongside powerful coolers to keep temperature down. Electricity is a big problem for these operations
            but in some countries electricity prices are low and this is why mining farms have concentrated in places
            with cheap electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it does mean that to mine Bitcoin you are up against very capable mining operations with a
            lot of capital behind them – it’s basically a competition against big companies around the globe that have a
            lot of money to spend. There are still countless individual Bitcoin miners too – and they tend to
            collaborate for profit by joining Bitcoin mining pools.
        </p>
        <p>Choosing a CPU
            As much as a CPU is really central to your computer it is not in fact the most important part in a Bitcoin
            mining rig. Yes, back when Bitcoin just launched you could mine using a CPU alone and you could do it
            profitably as long as your PC’s CPU had enough power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Miners worked hard to maximise their profits however so the result is that they tried different types of
            hardware for mining. They quickly found that CPUs are not the best options for mining Bitcoin. You still
            need to use a CPU to power your PC that runs the mining rig, but your CPU will take decades to mine a
            meaningful amount of Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>GPUs are not cheap, at several hundred dollars each, but there is a huge advantage for GPUs over CPUs when it
            comes to hashing. A good GPU could easily hash at hundred times the rate of a top-end CPU. This fact led to
            the rise of what is called a mining rig: a basic computer linked to a large number of GPUs – all dedicated
            to mining and to mine so as fast as possible. However, some people used these machines in a mixed-use
            configuration, for example playing 3D games at certain times while mining when they’re not gaming.</p>

        <p> However bad news for GPU mining surfaced quickly: today you cannot really mine Bitcoin profitably using
            GPUs. To cut a long story short, the more powerful mining equipment becomes the more difficult it becomes to
            mine Bitcoin. The result is that GPUs can no longer effectively mine Bitcoin compared to alternatives –
            which we’ll talk about below. So, you won’t make your money back in capital and electricity spend if you use
            a GPU to mine Bitcoin.</p>

        <p> FPGAs in Bitcoin mining
            GPUs were soon succeeded by something called a field programmable gate array, or FPGA. An integrated
            circuit, FPGA’s need to be configured after they are built but it does mean that a company which builds
            mining kit can buy a lot of FPGA and then set these up to be excellent at mining Bitcoin. FPGAs turned out
            to be a great option for mining Bitcoin and it changed the parameters for Bitcoin mining – removing GPUs
            from the playing field.</p>

        <p> In fact, FPGA mining rigs were the first mining kit which used hardware specifically designed for Bitcoin
            mining, and which could only be used to mine Bitcoin. In one key development it was quickly found that
            FPGA’s used a lot less power than GPUs – in fact, for the same hash rate, an FPGA could use less than 20% of
            the power of a GPU – which means mining operations were a lot more profitable.</p>
        <p>What are ASICs?
            The final stage in the Bitcoin mining arms race, application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs were
            chips designed from the ground up to mine Bitcoin. You can’t program an ASIC, it’s functionality is printed
            into its circuits and in the case of Bitcoin mining rigs ASICs could only be used to mine Bitcoin. Good
            ASICs could mine at 100 times the rate while using less electricity. At this stage there is no replacement
            technology for ASICs on the horizon, so ASICs remain the fastest way to mine Bitcoin for the foreseeable
            future.</p>

        <p> Of course, a custom-designed chip will be time consuming to make and fairly expensive. However this expense
            does come with results – a top of the line miner from a company such as AntMiner can get you to hash rates
            which are in the terahashes per second range – easily over 10TH/sec. The price? Over a thousand dollars. You
            get cheaper solutions too but the speed will be less. Working out mining profitability
            Getting your mining profits right is difficult and it does depend on hardware choice which is why mining
            beginners can find the choice of hardware a bit overwhelming to cope with. Getting your hardware choice
            right will determine you profits so you need to be able to calculate profitability to cover the cost of the
            hardware as well as the electricity you are consuming. It’s important that you make this calculation before
            you spend money on hardware because your hardware can be difficult to resell.</p>
        <p>
            Thankfully you can consult a pre-built calculator to help you – two options include BTC Mining Profit
            Calculator, which lets you add facts like the price you are paying for your hardware plus the hash rate you
            are achieving alongside the electricity you consume – it then takes the current price of Bitcoin and tells
            you whether your investment will reap rewards – or just end up costing you money. Another calculator you can
            try is the one from Genesis Block.</p>

        <p>Choosing mining software
            Thought choosing mining hardware will be difficult? You have even more choices to make – this time around
            the software you use for mining. You don’t need mining software for all types of mining rigs but you
            probably will – GPUs and FPGAs also need you to make available a computer you can use for mining, which acts
            as host for Bitcoin’s client plus the mining software you choose to use.</p>

        <p>why a Bitcoin client and mining software? Well, the Bitcoin client connects your miner to the bitcoin network
            and the mining software is the application which utilises your mining hardware to solve cryptography puzzles
            in order to solve transaction blocks – which of course is what you are rewarded for.</p>

        <p>Which are the most popular Bitcoin mining software options? We think you should check out one of these five
            solutions, depending on your exact needs:

        <p>Bitcoin Miner. It does what it says on the tin and is easy to use while offering a power saving mode as well
            as support for mining pools. This app is know for its ability to quickly submit shares and it also helps you
            to generate a profit report. For OS X or Windows.</p>
        <p>
            RPC Miner. If you’re a Mac user you will like RPC Miner because it closely integrates with OS X and the APIs
            in OS X – alongside OS X’s subsystems.

        <p>CGMiner. Supporting Linux, OS X and Windows, CGMiner comes with extra features including the ability to
            control fan speed alongside remote control. It detects new blocks on its own thanks to an internal database
            and supports both CPU and GPU mining, with support for multiple GPUs.</p>

        <p>BFGMiner. Need something that is designed for ASICs? Consider BFGMiner which is very similar to CGMiner
            except for the fact that it support ASICS. It also works across all the major PC operating systems.</p>

        <p>EasyMiner. With useful performance graphs EasyMiner is a great solution if you want support for a range of
            mining protocols. It can work in either solo or pool mode and is available for Linux and OS X.</p>

        <p>Understanding mining pools
            The computer resources required to mine Bitcoin has increased to the extent that successfully mining Bitcoin
            now requires you to compete against organisations with a lot of money, and which can set up big mining
            farms. So it is hard to mine solo and one of the ways to improve your ability to mine Bitcoin is for you to
            join a pool of Bitcoin miners.</p>
        <p>So in essence the easily obtainable Bitcoins were mined long ago so today mining is incredibly hard, like
            trying to find diamonds. The increasing value and popular appeal of Bitcoin has also drawn a lot of new
            players into the Bitcoin mining scene which makes the competition for mining new coins even tougher – it
            means that you simply need more and more powerful computing resources to mine a coin.</p>

        <p> Specialised mining gear is now key
            It’s not that you can’t mine – it just means that to make a profit you now need fairly specialised Bitcoin
            mining gear. Individuals trying to mine will often find that they simply spend more on the electricity they
            use to mine than what they get in return for mining. In part, access to cheap electricity is key to mining
            Bitcoin successfully today and so is scale – the ability to put together a very large mining operation.</p>

        <p> People who mine at home also need to cope with all sorts of issues ranging from the power going out through
            to hardware that breaks down and getting disconnected from the internet – not to mention crashed in the
            price of Bitcoin, which happen occasionally. It really is very difficult for people to mine Bitcoin at home
            and make any money at all.</p>

        <p> That doesn’t mean that the mining at home proposition won’t change: ASICs are becoming better and better
            while the software that handles the hardware is also becoming more capable. In the future all these factors
            could change so that individuals can again mine Bitcoin at home – which would be a good thing because it
            supports the decentralised aspect of Bitcoin. In other words, people mining Bitcoin at home prevents all the
            power from accumulating with a few large players.</p>

        <p> What you need to know about Bitcoin cloud mining
            There is an alternative to mining Bitcoin using your own equipment. It’s known as cloud mining, and it
            operates on a principal similar to other cloud services. Instead of owning your own computer equipment you
            “rent” mining capabilities from someone else. It’s a bit like buying a mining contract and in doing so you
            will be sharing in the vast computing capabilities of the company you contract with.</p>
